# unb-write-up-2019

Hi everyone!

I recently competed in my first Capture The Flag competition over the Canada Day long weekend. 
On my page, I posted a PDF of the challenges I faced and included my approach to tackling the challenge using  
Kali Liunx tools and 'trial and error'. 

I have also included the CTF files used during the competition for those of you who want a crack at the challenges but weren't avilable to do the competition live.  

Will provide a writeup of what I did first, got stuck on and other hurdles I faced when tackling these challenges, so stay tuned!
